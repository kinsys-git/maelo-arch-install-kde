# maelo-arch-install-kde

Personalized Arch install script, heavily borrowing from https://github.com/i3-Arch/Arch-Installer

If you want a generalized arch installer, that one is still better. This one will install my personalized KDE interface.

This script puts many dotfiles into a "dotfiles" directory in your home folder, which is downloaded from https://github.com/maelodic/dotfiles, and keeps the git file for my own repository. Feel free to fork.
