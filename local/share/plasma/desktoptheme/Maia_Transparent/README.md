# Theme for KDE Plasma 5

Based on default Manjaro KDE theme Maia:

https://github.com/manjaro/artwork-maia

Maia Transparent differs from original that it has a completely transparent panel and menu.

To install this theme, either clone/copy this repository or extract in ~/.local/share/plasma/desktoptheme/ for a local user or globally in /usr/share/plasma/desktoptheme/ .

After enabling it usually it is needed to reload plasmashell to remove initial panel's border leftovers.
